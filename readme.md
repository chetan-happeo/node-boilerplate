# Node.js Boilerplate

A boilerplate project for building Node.js applications with TypeScript, Sequelize, Inversify, Sentry, OpenTracing, and more.

## Features

- **TypeScript:** Write your code in TypeScript for better maintainability and developer experience.
- **Express.js:** Use Express.js as the web application framework.
- **Sequelize:** Sequelize ORM for database operations with support for MySQL.
- **Inversify:** Use Inversify for inversion of control and dependency injection.
- **Sentry:** Implement error tracking and monitoring with Sentry.
- **OpenTracing:** Implement distributed tracing with OpenTracing.
- **Swagger:** Generate and view API documentation with Swagger.
- **Bunyan:** Use Bunyan for structured logging with configurable log levels.
- **Class-Validator:** Implement input validation using class-validator.
- **Internationalization (i18n):** Support for internationalization of error messages.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14 or later)

    |-- app.ts            # Express application setup
    |-- index.ts          # Entry point

## API Documentation
API documentation is available using Swagger. Access the Swagger UI at http://localhost:3000/api-docs after starting the server.

## Error Tracking
Error tracking and monitoring are implemented with Sentry. Set your Sentry DSN in the configuration file.

## Logging
Structured logging with Bunyan is implemented. Configure log levels in the environment variables.

## Internationalization
Internationalization of error messages is implemented using i18n. Add your translations in the i18n files.

## Environment Variables
The following environment variables are used in the project:
   ```
   DB_NAME=your_database_name
   DB_USER=your_database_user
   DB_PASSWORD=your_database_password
   DB_HOST=your_database_host
   DB_DIALECT=mysql
   PORT=3000
   YOUR_SENTRY_DSN=your_sentry_dsn
   NODE_ENV=development
   LOG_LEVEL=debug
   DB_DIALECT=sqlite

   ```
## @todo - forwarding trace context
The trace context is forwarded to the downstream services using the `x-request-id` header. The `x-request-id` header is generated by the `request-id` middleware. The `request-id` middleware is implemented in the `middleware` folder.
